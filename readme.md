# Install

Run this command in your console. It puts a retropie setup file into `RetroPie-Setup`. You can then manage the package from the RetroPie Setup. It is located under experimental packages.

```
wget -P /home/pi/RetroPie-Setup/ext/dev_philcomm/scriptmodules/supplementary/ "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OfficialPhilcomm/retropie-wifi-manager/master/advanced-wifi.sh"
```
